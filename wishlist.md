would be nice ðŸ˜€

- [ ] potentially mgspw styled voiceline menu , could also just do something like cs/tf2 and just 1234556789~ (maybe just both menus as a changeable setting)
	- [ ] maybe with the niconico/bilibili style comment section up above (like mgspw)
	- [ ] potential to install "packs" of audio lines?
- [ ] agnostic of platforms
	- [ ] how to do? theories everyone please!
